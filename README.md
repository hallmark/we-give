# We Give

  We Give is a nonprofit micro-donations and virtual gift service created to help
  raise donations and awareness for small, grassroots charities.

## Status

  The We Give project, including both the underlying technical code as well as the
  nonprofit organization, has been dormant for a period of over a year.  Reasons
  include:
  
  * Uptake of the service was slow due to the barrier posed by Amazon Payments accounts
  * Facebook's transition away from application box content featured on user profiles
