        <p>
            At We Give we recognize that privacy is important. This Privacy Policy applies to all of the products, services and websites offered by We Give, LLC.; collectively, We Give's "services."
        </p>
        
        
        <h4>Information we collect and how we use it</h4>
        <p>
            We offer a number of services that do not require you to register for an account or provide any personal information to us, such as the We Give Facebook application. In order to provide our full range of services, we may collect the following types of information:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Information you provide</b> – When you sign up for a We Give Account or other We Give service or promotion that requires registration, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address and an account password). We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other We Give services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information.</li>
            <li><b>Cookies</b> – When you visit We Give, we send one or more cookies – a small file containing a string of characters – to your computer or other device that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service.</li>
            <li><b>Log information</b> – When you access We Give services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.</li>
            <li><b>User communications</b> – When you send email or other communications to We Give, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.</li>
            <li><b>Affiliated We Give Services on other sites</b> – We offer some of our services on or through other web sites, such as Facebook. Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to We Give in order to deliver the service. We process such information under this Privacy Policy. The affiliated sites through which our services are offered may have different privacy practices and we encourage you to read their privacy policies.</li>
            <li><b>Gadgets</b> – We Give may make available third party applications through its services. The information collected by We Give when you enable a gadget or other application is processed under this Privacy Policy. Information collected by the application or gadget provider is governed by their privacy policies.</li>
            <li><b>Links</b> – We Give may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed. We use this information to improve the quality of our service.</li>
            <li><b>Other sites</b> – This Privacy Policy applies to We Give services only. We do not exercise control over the sites that include We Give applications, products or services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            We Give only processes personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and/or the supplementary privacy notices for specific services. In addition to the above, such purposes include:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Providing our services, including the display of customized content and advertising;</li>
            <li>Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services;</li>
            <li>Ensuring the technical functioning of our network;</li>
            <li>Protecting the rights or property of We Give or our users; and</li>
            <li>Developing new services.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            We Give processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we process personal information on a server outside your own country. We may process personal information to provide our own services. In some cases, we may process personal information on behalf of and according to the instructions of a third party, such as our charity partners.
        </p>
        
        
        <h4>Choices for personal information</h4>
        
        <p>
            When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the specific service privacy notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the supplementary service privacy notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some We Give features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You can decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case We Give may not be able to provide those services to you.
        </p>
        
        
        <h4>Information sharing</h4>
        
        <p>
            We Give only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of We Give in the following limited circumstances:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.</li>
            <li>We provide such information to our affiliated companies or other trusted non-profit businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</li>
            <li>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of We Give, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            If We Give becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who donated to a given charity, for example, or how many users clicked on a particular gift. Such information does not identify you individually.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Please contact us for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data.
        </p>
        
        
        <h4>Accessing and updating personal information</h4>
        
        <p>
            When you use We Give services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.
        </p>
        
        
        <h4>Enforcement</h4>
        
        <p>
            We Give regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or We Give’s treatment of personal information by contacting us through this web site.
        </p>
        
        
        <h4>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4>
        
        <p>
            Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page. Each version of this Privacy Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date.
